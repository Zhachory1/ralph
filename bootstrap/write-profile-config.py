"""Copy the blocks Ralph owns from a repo profile into an installed profile.

Ralph owns four things in a Hermes config.yaml: which model a profile runs,
which toolsets it may use, whether its unattended runs may use the tools that
would otherwise wait for an approval nobody is there to give, and which skill
lanes it mounts. Everything else is generated and version-specific, so it is
left exactly as found.

Toolsets are not cosmetic. A profile without the toolset its job needs reads
its brief, reasons about the work, and then cannot act: the orchestrator went
a whole feature without the kanban toolset, so it could describe a card graph
and never create one. Copying only the model block is what hid that.

Skills are the same failure in a new place. This list is an allowlist, so a
block it does not name is dropped in silence: the profile files said which
lanes to mount, the installed configs did not, and `skills list` showed the
builtins alone. A block added to a profile and not added here does nothing,
and says nothing about doing nothing.

A freshly created profile has no config.yaml at all until something writes one.
